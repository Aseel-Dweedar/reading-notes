# SCRIPTS

**A Script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

`create a script`

 1. **DEFINE THE GOAL:** first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
2. **DESIGN THE SCRIPT:** You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them. 

    **Notes:**
    + Computers are very logical and obedient. They need to be told every detail of what they are expected to do, and they will do it without question. Because they need different types of instructions .

    + sketching out the tasks in a *Flowchart* .


3. **CODE EACH STEP:** Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands.


# EXPRESSIONS & OPERATORS
**Expressions** rely on **operators** to calculate a single value from one or more values.

**Note:**
When you place quotes around a number, it is a **string** (not a numeric data type), and you cannot perform addition operations on strings. 

# FUNCTION
**Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. it is like a **store** ; it holds the statements that are contained in the curly braces until you are ready to use them. Those statements are not run until the function is **called** .

**DECLARE**


`finction sayHi() {`

`document.write('Hi');`

`}`


**CALL**

`sayHi();`
