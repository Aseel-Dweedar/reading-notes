# REST

### **1. Who is Roy Fielding?**

A guy helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.


### **2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.

### **3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

### **4. What does a GET do?**

when the systems would retrieve information from each other.

### **.5 What does a POST do?**

If one system needs to add something to another system.

### **.6 What does PUT do?**

If a system wants to replace something in another system.

### **.7 What does PATCH do?**

If a system wants to do a partial update.
