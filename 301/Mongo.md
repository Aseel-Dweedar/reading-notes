# SQL vs NoSQL

## **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

| SQL                                    | NoSQL                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | called as non-relational or distributed database                       |
| table based databases whereas          | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| have predefined schema                 | have dynamic schema                                                    |
| vertically scalable                    | horizontally scalable                                                  |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) | queries are focused on collection of documents                         |

### **1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

### **2. Give a real world example.**

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

### **3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

### **4. Give a real world example.**

MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

### **5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL.

### **6. Which type of database is best for scalability?**

SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.

# SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB

### **1.What does SQL stand for?**

structured query language.

### **2. What is a relational database?**

database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports the SQL language the structured query language.

### **3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

tables.

### **4. What is a ‘schema’?**

schema is defined by so-called fields.

### **5. What is a NoSQL database?**

built to store lots of data in a very efficient way.

### **6. How does it work?**

we don't have tables but we have so-called documents, they look a bit like JSON. they don't have to use the same schema you can have multiple documents in one collection which have different fields.

### **7. What is inside of a Mongo database?**

different documents in one and the same collection.

### **8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB. because you can easily add a new data.

### **9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

you can put all the information in one place. you don't really need to query that connect data because you got the data you need in each collection.
have less relation merging going on have super fast and efficient queries.
