# Choosing A Text Editor:

***Text editors*** are all pretty similar, and the best text editor is the one that you enjoy using the most.

***The features*** should you look for in a text editor:

1. code completion.
2. syntax highlighting.
3. a nice variety of themes.
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions.


The text editors that already come on computers don't support these features. some of text editors that you can download on the computer can gives you all of these features.

***For example:***
**Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.**

***Text Editors VS IDEs:*** the text editor manages text, and manages files. but IDE's are an Integrated Development Environment, different software all coming together.
