## Structure:

*Structure* helps readers understand the content, For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information.


***HTML code***  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. 

`EX:\<h1> and \</h1>`

> **Note that:**
The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.

***Attributes*** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

> **Note that:**
The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes

* If you want to add a **comment** to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters: 

   \<!-- comment goes here -->

* **id attribute & class attribute** used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page :

    \<p id="pullquote">

    \<p class="important">


* **\<div>** element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.


* The **\<span>** element acts like an inline equivalent of the \<div> element. It is used to either:

     1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
     2. Contain a number of inline elements.

* **\<iframe>** An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.


* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.


# HTML5 Layout:
**HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.**

* Headers & Footers <header\> <footer\>
* Navigation <nav\>
* Articles <article\>
* Article <aside\>
* Sections <section\>
* Heading groups <hgroup\>
* Figures <figure\> <figcaption\>
* Sectioning Elements <div\>

# Process  &  Design

1. Study your audience.
2. Site Maps, organize the information into sections or pages.
3. Create WireFrame, It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
4. Study the elements of design, Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
