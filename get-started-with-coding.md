## **Check your Version Control:**
Fires and the most important step to start your coding life, is to check your Version Control. Why?
Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. remember that you will never work alone in this field.

## ***Git*** 

is a distributed version controlthat, stores data in a file system. Integrated local machine, which helps you to:
* Save a changed, and tracking them.
* Continue work on a project even when not online.
* minimize the possibility of irreversible damage or lost data.


>Don't forget to download it with the extensions.
Search for commands that you can use to make your life easier.

```
Example :To check settings, use the (`git config --list`) command.
```

1. Saving Changes: All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.
2. Check File Status: To determine the state of files.
   * `$ git status`
3. Tracking and Staging a New File:
   * Single File : `git add <filename>`
   * All Files: `$ git add *`
4. Committing a File: changes and record what you did within the commit message.
   * `$ git commit -m “made change x,y,z”`
5. Pushing Changes: push changes to a remote repository.
   * `$ git push origin master`
